# About
Exercise: How to think cs - section 9.8, pg.104.

# Exercise
As an exercise, write a function called historgram that takes a list and a number of buckets as arguments and returns a histogram with the given number of buckets.

# Explanation
This exercise is based on a program that connects functions from the following sections: 
 - 9.6, and
 - 9.7.

# Notes
Section 9.8 discusses implementing a 'single-pass' solution. Its aim is to traverse the list only once. The program, in its current form, traverses the list for every bucket. I did not implement the solution from 
section 9.8 but I have met the exercise's requirments (as outlined in the exercise section above).
