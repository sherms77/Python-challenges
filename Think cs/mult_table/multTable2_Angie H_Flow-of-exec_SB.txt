# Flow of execution
# 1. Call createtable function.
# 2. Evaluate condition, is i in range 1 to height+1?
# 3. If yes, call createrow function.
# 4. Evaluate condition, is i in range 1 to n+1?
# 5. If yes, i multiplies row, tabs a space after result, prints on single line.
# 6. If i is less than n+1, execute each statement in the for loop and go back to step 4.
# 7. When the condition i in range 1 to n+1 is met, exit the for loop.
# 8. Execute the next statement. 
# 9. Go back to step 1, createtable function.
# 10. When the condition i is less than height+1 is met, exit the for loop.
