# Flow of execution sample - How to think like a cs P.63
# 1. Evaluate the condition, yielding 0 or 1.
# 2. If the condition is False (0), exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.
# 3. If the condition is True (1), execute each of the statements in the body then go back to step 1.

# Createrow - Flow of execution v1
# 1. Function has two paramaters, n and row.
# 2. Sets the condition for i, i will be range 1 to n+1.
# 3. Number in i variable starts with 1 and iterates. 
# 4. Every iteration of i multiplies the argument passed to the row paramater.
# 5. Every iterative result of i*row prints to the screen.
# 6. Condition is checked and repeated until its met.
# 7. When the condition is met, loop ends.
# 8. New line is printed.

# Createtable - Flow of exection v1
# 1. Function has two parameters, height and width.
# 2. Sets the condition for i, i will be range 1 to height+1.
# 3. Createrow function is called.
# 4. Createrow function takes arguments width and i.
# 5. Width is passed to n in createrow.
# 6. i is passed to row in createrow.
# 7. Createrows is executed until its condition is met.
# 8. Returns to Createtable function.

100221: I ONLY SAW THIS ANGIE'S COMMENT TODAY BY ACCIDENT.
100221: ACCORDING TO ANGIE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUNCTION DOES.

# Createrow - Flow of execution v2 - mutlTable2_AngieH.py
# 1. Evaluate condition, is i in range 1 to n+1?
# 2. If yes, i multiplies row, tabs each result, prints on single line.
# 3. If i is less than n+1, execute each statement in body and go back to step 1.
# 4. When condition is met, exit the for statement and execute the next statement.

# Createtable - Flow of execution v2
# 1. Evaluate condition, is i in range 1 to height+1?
# 2. If yes, call Createrow function.
# 3. If i is less than height+1, execute each statement in the body.
# 4. When condition is met, exit the for statement.
