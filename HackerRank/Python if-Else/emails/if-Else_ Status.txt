Hi,

I committed changes to the repo this morning. It shows my work from
yesterday. If you refer to the notes file you can see what I have done. The
link in my last email will take you to the GitHub repo.

I was looking over the code that fb users one and two gave me and note that
they did not use a condition for the constraint in the problem spec (from
what I can tell).

I don't know if the way they wrote the code and the absence of the
constraint means that the constraint is applied by default.

I replicated fb user one's code and it failed some of my tests for the
constraint so his code is flawed imo.

I don't want to use someone else's code. I know I can as long as I
understand it, but I would rather come up with my own solution (even if
it's not as elegant as others) to help me understand it for myself.

Anyway, let me know what you think of my code when you get time. I read the
fb message you sent me yesterday. Thanks for trying to fit in reviewing my
code.

Regards
Sherman
