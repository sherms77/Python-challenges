I'm working on a Python HackerRank challenge and I'm unable to past the test cases.
I coded the solution out in vs code and obtained the correct output using the test cases.
The test cases are: out[3]: Weird and out[24]: Not Weird.
However, when I test the code in the HackerRank editor, it does not pass the test cases and I get a wrong answer. I get mixed results when I try variations on calling the function. I have tried:
1.Using no function calls - I fail both test cases.
2.Using one function call - I pass the test case for the input I used in the function call and fail the other.
3.Calling the function twice with each input - I pass one test case and fail the other.
4.Used the custom input option with one input - I get a message that says complilation is a success but there is no stdout.
5.Used the custom input option with both inputs - I get a message that says complilation is a success but there is no stdout.

Link to challenge and my code is below.
Note: I'm using Python 3.

If anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong and how I can get the code to pass the test cases that would be great. Thanks.
