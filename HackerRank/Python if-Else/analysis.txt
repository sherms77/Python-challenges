PROBLEM SPEC
Given an integer n, perform the following conditional actions:
    - if n is odd, print Weird.
    - if n is even and in the inclusive range 2 to 5, print Not Weird.
    - if n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird.
    - if n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird.

--input format--
a single line containing a positive integer, n.

--constraints--
1 <= n <= 100 
constraint expplained in plain english: 
    - n has to be in between 1 and 100. 
    - n has to be equal to or greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100.
    - if n exceeds this range the input is invalid.

REQUIREMENTS
1.1<= n <=100 - Constraint: n cannot be above or below this range. Problem spec does not specify action for invalid input.
2.if n is odd, print Weird.
3.if n is even and between inclusive range 2 to 5, print Not Weird.
4.if n is even and between inclusive range 6 to 20, print Weird.
5.if n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird.

BEST VERSION OF MY CODE
failed 2/8 test cases.
decided to work with this version of the code.
it includes the constraint and has the rules in order.
it only failed 2/8 test cases. Other versions also only failed 2/8 test cases but I think this captures all the requirements effectively.

ANALYSIS 
each requirement broken down.
try to pinpoint what requirement(s) are not being met.
300421: I rewrote code in if-Else(7).py and analysed each requirement. Code works as intended.
