RULES
Invalid input: constraints: 1 <= n <= 100
Rule 1: if n is odd print Weird
Rule 2: if n is even and in the inlcusive range of 2 to 5 print Not Weird
Rule 3: if n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 print Weird
Rule 4: if n is even and greater than 20 print Not Weird

STEPS
1.Create rule for invalid input: constraints - DONE
2.Create function for rule 1 - DONE
3.Create function for rule 2 - DONE
4.Create function for rule 3 - DONE
5.Create function for rule 4 - DONE
6.Go over probelm spec and intended output.
7.Draw flow chart.
8.Combine functions into one function. UP TO HERE.
9.Test in HackerRank editor.

NOTES
170321: ADDED TWO NEW STEPS. NOW UP TO STEP 6 - APPLYING METHOD 2 TO STEP 8.
170321: Need to only have one output based on correct rule. Needs to break out of loop when it meets relevant rule.
170321: Go over problem spec and expected output again. One argument can meet more than one rule.
170321: Refer to failed code 170321 and comments in ifElse_hr_myCode(2).py.
160321: UP TO STEP 6. REFER TO ifElse_hr_myCode(2).py.
160321: Method 1 for step 6 failed. Refer to failed code 160321. Will try method 2. Refer to ifElse_hr_myCode(2).py.
150321: Try two methods to combine functions:
    1.Use main function and call each function in main, and
    2.Put code from all functions into one function.
    SEE WHICH ONE WORKS BETTER. 
150323: Finished step 5. UP TO STEP 6.
130321: Finsihed step 4. UP TO STEP 5.
120321: Finsihed step 3. UP TO STEP 4.
110321: Finished step 2. UP TO STEP 3. Consider putting all code into one function when finished.
100321: WORKING ON STEP 2 - RULE 1 FUNCTION. Refer to line 30.
ISSUE: main(200) gives two outputs: 'invalid input' and 'outside of range' - look into.
invalid(x): constraint 1 <= n <= 100
rule_two(y): if n is even and in the within the range of 2 to 5 print "Not Weird"
