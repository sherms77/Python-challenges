RULES
Invalid input: constraints: 1 <= n <= 100
Rule 1: if n is odd print Weird
Rule 2: if n is even and in the inlcusive range of 2 to 5 print Not Weird
Rule 3: if n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 print Weird
Rule 4: if n is even and greater than 20 print Not Weird

STEPS
1.Create rule for invalid input: constraints - DONE
2.Create function for rule 1 - DONE
3.Create function for rule 2 - DONE
4.Create function for rule 3 - DONE
5.Create function for rule 4 - UPTO HERE
6.Combine functions into one function.
7.Test in HackerRank editor.

NOTES
130321: Finsihed step 4. UPTO STEP 5.
120321: Finsihed step 3. UPTO STEP 4.
110321: Finished step 2. UPTO STEP 3. Consider putting all code into one function when finished.
100321: WORKING ON STEP 2 - RULE 1 FUNCTION. Refer to line 30.
ISSUE: main(200) gives two outputs: 'invalid input' and 'outside of range' - look into.
invalid(x): constraint 1 <= n <= 100
rule_two(y): if n is even and in the within the range of 2 to 5 print "Not Weird"
